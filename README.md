# AI Lab - Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CS 39002)

This project is part of the **Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (AI Lab)** course in the 6th semester. The course focuses on hands-on implementation of AI techniques, including search algorithms, heuristics, and optimization strategies.

## Course Objectives

- Design and analyze AI algorithms.
- Gain proficiency in Python and tools like Google Colab.
- Solve real-life problems using AI concepts.

## Assignments

### 1. **Maze Solver (BFS & DFS)**
   - Implement BFS and DFS algorithms to solve a maze.
   - Compare the number of nodes explored in both methods.

### 2. **Route Finder (Bi-Directional BFS/DFS)**
   - Apply bi-directional search for efficient city navigation.

### 3. **Treasure Hunt (Best-First Search)**
   - Use Manhattan distance as a heuristic to find the treasure.

### 4. **Optimal Path (Uniform Cost Search)**
   - Solve weighted graphs to find the least-cost path.

### 5. **Puzzle Solver (A Star-Search)**
   - Solve the 8-puzzle problem using A* with two heuristics: misplaced tiles and Manhattan distance.

### 6. **Robot Path Planning (A Star-Search)**
   - Plan a robotâ€™s path using A*, comparing Manhattan and Euclidean heuristics.

### 7. **Game AI**
   - Implement search algorithms for games like Tic-Tac-Toe.

### 8. **Navigation with Multiple Goals**
   - Solve multi-goal problems using BFS, DFS, and A*.

### 9. **AI Planner (Task Scheduling)**
   - Optimize task scheduling with A* using task dependencies and durations.

### 10. **Comparative Study**
   - Compare BFS, DFS, Bi-Directional BFS, Uniform Cost, Best-First, and A* search algorithms.

### 11. **Hill Climbing Optimization**
   - Implement Hill Climbing optimization for solving AI problems.

### 12. **Genetic Algorithm**
   - Solve search problems using a Genetic Algorithm.

### 13. **Water-Jugs Problem (Adversarial Search)**
   - Use Minimax and alpha-beta pruning to solve the Water-Jugs problem.

### 14. **4-Queens Problem (Adversarial Search)**
   - Solve the 4-Queens problem using Minimax and alpha-beta pruning.

### 15. **Tower of Hanoi (Adversarial Search)**
   - Implement the Tower of Hanoi as a competitive game using Minimax and alpha-beta pruning.

### 16. **8-Puzzle Problem (Heuristic Search)**
   - Compare A* and Greedy Best-First Search algorithms for solving the 8-puzzle.
