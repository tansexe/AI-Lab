   - Use bi-directional search to minimize node exploration in city navigation.  

**3. Treasure Hunt (Best-First Search)**  
   - Find a treasure using Manhattan distance as a heuristic.  

**4. Optimal Path (Uniform Cost Search)**  
   - Solve weighted graphs to find the least-cost path.  

**5. Puzzle Solver (A* Search)**  
   - Solve the 8-puzzle with A* using two heuristics: misplaced tiles and Manhattan distance.  

**6. Robot Path Planning (A*)**  
   - Plan a robotâ€™s path with A*, comparing Manhattan and Euclidean heuristics.
